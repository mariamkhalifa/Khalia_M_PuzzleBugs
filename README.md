Fixing Bugs In The Puzzle:

The drag and drop puzzle was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Ther are 2 bugs in the drag and drop puzzle.
Going to fix each bug in a seperate branch then merge both branches to master.

The first bug is that the drop zone allows multiple peices to be dropped in the same spot. For the best ux, each drop zone should allow only one peice to be dropped then should not allow any more peices to be dropped in the same spot. 

The second bug is that the old puzzle remains in the drop zone even after resetting and choosing a different puzzle. For the best ux, the old puzzle peices should disappear from the board when the user chooses a new puzzle.
